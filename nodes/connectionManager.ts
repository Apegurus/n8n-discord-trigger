 * Connection Manager for IPC client connections.
 *
 * Tracks two separate concepts:
 * 1. connectionCount: Number of currently active workflows (goes up/down with activate/deactivate)
 * 2. registeredNodes: Which nodes have event listeners attached to the IPC socket
 *
 * KEY INSIGHT: Event listeners persist on ipc.of.bot until the socket is destroyed.
 * So we must NOT remove from registeredNodes when a workflow deactivates, because
 * the listeners are still there! Only when ALL workflows deactivate (and we disconnect IPC)
 * do the listeners get cleared.
 *
 * This solves two issues:
 * 1. Deactivating one workflow would disconnect the shared IPC socket and break all other workflows
 * 2. Reactivating a workflow would add duplicate event listeners causing duplicate events
